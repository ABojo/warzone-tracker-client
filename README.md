You can test Warzone Tracker here: https://abojo.github.io/warzone-tracker-client/

Warzone Tracker is a React based web app that allows Warzone players to check their global stats and recent matches.

This app communicates with my <a href='https://github.com/ABojo/warzone-tracker-server'>warzone-tracker-server</a> repository to fetch player data. The server is responsible for authenticating with Activision's servers,
requesting the player's data from them, and then filtering/formatting the data before returning it to the client.
